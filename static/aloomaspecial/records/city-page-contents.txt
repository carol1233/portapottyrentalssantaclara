Common Pitfalls When Renting Portable Toilets<h2>
Renting portable restrooms might seem straightforward, but overlooking key details can lead to logistical headaches and unsanitary conditions. One major mistake is underestimating the number of units required for the crowd size and event duration, leading to overused and unpleasant facilities. Placing units in areas that are inaccessible to service trucks is another frequent error that prevents our technicians from performing necessary cleaning and pumping. Many renters forget to account for adequate lighting around the restroom area, creating safety hazards for guests using the facilities after dark. Failing to secure the units against high winds or uneven ground can result in tipping accidents, which are both dangerous and costly to remediate. We guide our clients through these potential issues during the planning phase to ensure a flawless sanitation strategy.

Common Rental Pitfalls to Evade<h2>

Many first-time renters make avoidable mistakes that can complicate their sanitation logistics. One common error is placing units in areas that are inaccessible to our service trucks; remember, we need to get within 25 feet to pump and clean the unit. Another mistake is forgetting to account for lighting if the event extends into the evening; standard units do not have internal lights. Renters also frequently overlook the need for handwashing stations, which are essential for food-service events. Additionally, waiting until the last minute to book can result in limited inventory, especially during peak seasons. By consulting with us early in your planning process, you can avoid these headaches and ensure a smooth rental experience. We are here to guide you past these obstacles.
